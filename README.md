A small starter project as a first proper Gameboy game written 100% in assembly, released in 2020.

Currently the game supports two game modes: an "alternating" 2 player mode, meaning that two players take turns on the same console, as well as a singleplayer mode against an AI.

Support for a Link-Cable-based multiplayer mode is planned.

The game fully supports Gameboy Color features, but also runs perfectly fine on a non-color Gameboy version.
